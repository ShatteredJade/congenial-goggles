# congenial-goggles (WIP)

A banking app that allows users to freely divide their financial goals into buckets and residences. 

## Buckets

Buckets are specific a measure of how much one wants to save towards a specific financial goal (i.e. Ryan's College Fund)

There can be one of two types of buckets, growing and static.

Static is a fixed amount one wants to save that does not change as you reach your goal (i.e. $5000 towards Ryan's College Fund)

Growing is a dynamic amount in which a user must contribute monthly towards their goal (i.e. $150 a month towards Vacation Savings)

## Residences

Residences are a large group in which buckets reside. For example; 'Ryan's College Fund' may reside within a larger residence called 'Children's College Funds', where you may have multiple funds for multiple children
